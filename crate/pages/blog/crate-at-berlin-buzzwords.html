We love Berlin, we love Berlin Buzzwords!

That's also one of the reasons why we're proud to be one of the bronze sponsors at the event. Our entire Core Team will be there and is looking forward to talk with you about Crate. Look out for the "Big Data Mountain Guides".

We're also at the Barcamp. Matthias will do an intro talk about Crate.
